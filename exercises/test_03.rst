# Using numpy.testing

numpy.testing provides utilities to make assertions about numpy arrays.


## Instructions

1. Add new tests to check that `interaction` can optionally accept numpy arrays
   as input arguments.

   You can use:

   ```python

   from numpy.testing import assert_array_equal
   from numpy.testing import assert_array_almost_equal
   ```

   Update the implementation to make the tests pass.
